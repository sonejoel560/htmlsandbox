    <!-- Non breaking space -->
    <p>Let's say you wanted to create a bunch of white space for a specific word in your page e.g I am       small fry.
You see there's no difference in the browser as it's not going to see these spaces.</p>
<p>If you wanted to do this, you'll make use of a non breaking space e.g I am &nbsp; &nbsp; small fry</p>
<!-- Greater than and lass than -->
<p>5 > 2 If you want to actually put an angle bracket on a page it's very much wiser to use the entity '&gt; or &#62; for greater than and' '&lt; or &#60; for less than'
    <p>e.g 5 &gt; 2 and 1 &lt; 2</p>
    <p>5 &#62; 2 and 1 &#60; 2</p>
